## üåÉ Abstract

- Minecraft version: `1.12.2`
- Languages: `ENG` | `RU`
- Mod's aimed at working inside the modpack (esp. with mods `Divine RPG` and `AppliedEnergistics 2`);
- Mod adds solution of some **trouble**;

What's more, **angelic armor** loses the durability really fast.

So, mod adds **'exe' armor** which provides flying and high durability index, **but** armor has pretty hard craft - here we go to the next part:
